Code to process Guinea-PIG files is in lumiprep.sh.

This is still a WIP but can be launched as a batch job using slurm_lumiprep.sh 
once GP jobs finish (or can be integrated with the GP job).
This creates a sub-directrory named PP (for post-processing).

Pieces.

1. Prepare the pair files with the information from the tracked electron-positron pair 
   (here the scattered Bhabha event).
   The result is a root file eg. Z-126.root that contains a TTree with 32 fields.
   These are the eepairs root files.
   
2. Prepare a lumi TTree with the information from the lumi.ee.out file.

3. Make sure the ReadandDerive executable is made.
   Do
      module load root
      ./cl.sh ReadandDerive from the ${CODEBASE} directory.
      
   Run the ReadandDerive executable that superimposes initial Bhabha scattering e+e- pairs 
   on "luminosity events". May make sense to make the output dumps persistent as files.
   Currently this just prints the DerivedLumi and BhabhaLumiEvent structs for the first 10 events.
   
   The code has a few options. Do ${CODEBASE}/ReadandDerive -h to see them.
   
(Still to port to HPC)   
4. Run the "analysis" code that analyses the eepairs ROOT files. This will likely need 
   continued development.
   It consists of two files.
   Ana.C and Ana.h
   
   So the procedure is 
   
   cp $CODEBASE/Ana.C .
   cp $CODEBASE/Ana.h .
   root -l Z-126.root
   t->Process("Ana.C+")
   mv Ana.root Ana-Z-126.roto
