Code to process Guinea-PIG files is in lumiprep.sh.

This is still a WIP but can be launched as a batch job using slurm_lumiprep.sh 
once GP jobs finish (or can be integrated with the GP job).
This creates a sub-directrory named PP (for post-processing) in each GP output directory.
It likely may need to be customized to your setup.

Pieces.

1. Prepare the pair files with the information from the tracked electron-positron pair 
   (here the scattered Bhabha event).
   The result is a root file eg. Z-126.root that contains a TTree with 32 fields.
   These are the eepairs root files.
   
2. Prepare a lumi TTree with the information from the lumi.ee.out file.

3. Make sure the ReadandDerive executable is made.
   Do
      module load root
      ./cl.sh ReadandDerive from the ${CODEBASE} directory.
      
   Run the ReadandDerive executable that superimposes initial Bhabha scattering e+e- pairs 
   on "luminosity events". May make sense to make the output dumps persistent as files.
   Currently just prints the DerivedLumi and BhabhaLumiEvent structs for the first 10 events. 
   It also fills some histograms that are saved in EMD-${RUN}-Analysis.root.
   
   The ReadandDerive.cpp code has a few options. Do ${CODEBASE}/ReadandDerive -h to see them. 
   This is I think a quite good way - even dare I say exemplary way to run code in 
   various different configurations.
   Please have a look at the code it also includes the varius Lorentz boosts.
     
4. Run the "analysis" code that analyses the eepairs ROOT files and creates a ROOT file 
   with the results (here Ana-${RUN}.root). This will likely need further 
   and continuing development. It consists of two files, Ana.C and Ana.h.
   Normally Ana.h will not need to be further changed.
   The macro.C code launches Ana.C.
   
   The script snippet that does this is
   # Run current eepairs file analysis
   cp ${CODEBASE}/Ana.* .
   cp ${CODEBASE}/macro.C .
   # Run root in "batch mode" using macro.C to process the eepairs root file 
   root -l -b -q ${RUN}.root macro.C
   mv Ana.root Ana-${RUN}.root
   # Clean up
   rm Ana_*
   rm *.C
   rm *.h
